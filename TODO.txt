(Adam) Thoughts:
- Maybe we need to define the best starting position beforehand for every player/every video to get the best result. 
At least for me it's sometimes very hard to click on the correct pixel when choosing players in background. 
However, there are a lot of parameters to be tweaked between every player for best result, so we probably can't do all in "one go" regardless.

(Woj) Thoughts:
- We should assume that we are *always* just looking at the shirt so that it's easier to extrapolate it to the legs. Could take the distance between centre and top as a reference.

TODO for player detection:

- Figure out how to define starting param when players are outside frame
- Improve algorithm when players disappear outside of frame
- Figure out how to track players in background (combine colour tracking with edge detections(Harris/Tomasi, Lucas/Kanadi?) or Sift descriptors?)
- Figure out how to stay on one player when occluded or when players cross (exemples: RedFront in vid5, GreenPlayers in vid3)
- Find optimal parameters and starting position for every player/video (UPDATE README.md)

- Calculate where the player's feet are (depends on what we track and the relative camera position)
- Detect jumps (could use moveVec and add a jump after the highest peak has been reached)
- Calculate player position during jumps
- 
Also, see TODOs in code
